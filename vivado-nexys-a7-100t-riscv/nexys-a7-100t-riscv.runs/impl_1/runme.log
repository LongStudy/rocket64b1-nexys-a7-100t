If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP riscv_i/RocketChip/inst/rocket_system/tile_prci_domain/tile_reset_domain_tile/fpuOpt/sfma/fma/_mulAddResult_T__0 multiplier stage riscv_i/RocketChip/inst/rocket_system/tile_prci_domain/tile_reset_domain_tile/fpuOpt/sfma/fma/_mulAddResult_T__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal riscv_i/DDR/mig_7series_0/u_riscv_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the riscv_i/DDR/mig_7series_0/u_riscv_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of riscv_i/DDR/mig_7series_0/u_riscv_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
